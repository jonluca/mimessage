# Mimessage

Welcome to the iMessage Alternative UI project! This is an open-source alternative user interface for Apple's native iMessage application, built using TypeScript, Electron, and Kysely.

## Features

This alternative UI provides several advanced features, including:

1. **Regex Search**: Search your conversations using powerful regular expressions to find specific messages or patterns.
2. **Custom Filters**: Apply custom filters to refine your search results and find exactly what you're looking for.
3. **Conversation Export**: Export all the data of a given conversation in a user-friendly format for archival purposes or analysis.
4. **Media Export**: Easily export all media (images, videos, etc.) from a conversation to a separate folder.

Please note that this application is for viewing and managing iMessage conversations only. It does **NOT** allow you to send messages.

## Installation

To install the iMessage Alternative UI, follow these steps:
