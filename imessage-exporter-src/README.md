# imessage-exporter

This crate provides both a library to interact with iMessage data as well as a binary that can perform some useful read-only operations using that data.

## Binary

The `imessage-exporter` binary exports iMessage data to `txt` or `html` formats. It can also run diagnostics to find problems with the iMessage database.

Installation instructions for the binary are located [here](imessage-exporter/README.md).

## Library

The `imessage_database` library provides models that allow us to access iMessage information as native data structures.

Documentation for the library is located [here](imessage-database/README.md).
